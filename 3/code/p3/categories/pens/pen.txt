A ballpoint pen is a writing instrument that dispenses ink onto paper through a small metal ball at the tip. The ball rotates freely and rolls as you write, picking up ink from the reservoir inside the pen and depositing it on the paper. Ballpoint pens are convenient, widely used, and come in various colors and styles for different writing purposes.
